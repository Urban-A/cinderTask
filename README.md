# Changelog
Tasks 2-6 should now be fully completed including bonuses, task 7 is not.

## 2
Adjusted rendering and collision to work better with rotation, collision is still handled by a click event in the main program asking each shape if the mouse coordinates are colliding with it as I don't know how I would only delete the topmost shape if each shape had it's own click event. 

## 3
Added a rogue property, slight changes to window look.

## 4
Changes to file saving, implemented loading from file.

## 5
Added rotation.

## 6
Implemented shader, harmonica window and bonuses.
